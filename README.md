Editing of text in ex0/5.js is done by first replacing " " with ": " in notepad and using Python command line input to partition every line at ": " and adding " '' " to the third element in the tuple at front and back and then merging it.
```
  ans=""
  x = input()
  x = x.partition(" ")
  ans += "".join([x[0],": ","'"+x[2]+"'"])
  ans += "\n"
  then print(ans) after iterating over every line input in the python console.
